##Introduction

The Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER), which presents itself as a tool for the management of water resources, is based on the modeling of the $\frac{ET_a}{ET_0}$ ratio. 

The surface albedo ($\alpha_0$) was obtained from the reflectivity for each band ($\alpha_{pb}$). For Landsat images was necessary to obtain the planetary albedo ($\alpha_{pb}$) applying this equation for each band:

$$\alpha_{pb} = \frac{L_b \pi d^2}{R cos \phi}$$

Where $L_b$ ($W \ m^{-2} \ sr^{-1} \ \mu m^{-1}$) is the spectral radiance for the wavelenghts of the band ($b$ from 1 to 7), $d$ ($m$) is the relative earth-sun distance, $R$ ($W \ m^{-2} \ \mu m^{-1}$) is the mean solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere for each band and $\phi$ the solar zenith angle.

The broadband $\alpha_p$ was calculated as the total sum of the differenct reflectivities $\alpha_{pb}$  values according to the weights for each band ($w_p$):

$$\alpha_p = \sum w_p \alpha_{pb}$$

The data of $\alpha_p$ was atmospherically corrected to obtain the value of surface albedo ($\alpha_0$):

$$\alpha_0 = 0.61 \times \alpha_p + 0.08$$

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated through the ratio of the difference between the planetary reflectivities of the near infrared ($\rho_{nir}$) and red ($\rho_{red}$) and their sum. 


Net radiation ($R_N, W \ m^{-2} \ sr^{-1} \ \mu \ m^{-1}$) was obtained by the Slob's equation:

$$R_N = (1 - \alpha_0) R_G - \alpha_L \tau_{sw}$$

The ratio between actual evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration ($ET_a \ ET_0^{-1}$) was calculated according to:


$$\frac{ET_a}{ET_0} = exp \left[ a+b \left( \frac{T_0}{\alpha_0 NDVI} \right) \right]$$


Actual evapotranspiration ($ET_a, mm \ day^{-1}$) was obtained according to:

$$ET_a = ET_0 \left( \frac{ET_a}{ET_0} \right)$$
Latent heat flux ($LE, MJ \ day^{-1}$) was obtained by:

$$LE = ET_a \times 2.45 $$

Heat flow in the soil ($G, MJ \ day^{-1}$) was estimated through its realtionship with the net radiation:

$$\frac{ G}{R_N} = 3.98 \ exp(-31.89 \alpha_0)$$

Sensible heat flux ($H, MJ \ day^{-1}$) was obtained as a residue of the energy balance:

$$H = R_N - LE - G $$

Raster files named "Alb_24.tif", "NDVI.tif", "LST.tif", "Rn_MJ", "kc.tif" and "evapo.tif" will be generated with the same projection as the raster input.

###Radiation and energy balance at 250 m resolution

With MODIS bands in the workspace, run:

```
radiation_modis(doy, RG, Ta, ET0, a, b)
```

Where:

-  doy is the Day of Year (DOY)
-  RG  is the global solar radiation ($MJ \ day^{-1}$)
-  Ta  is the average air temperature (Celsius degrees)
-  ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration ($mm \ day^{-1}$)
-  a   is one of the regression coefficients of SAFER algorithm
-  b   is one of the regression coefficients of SAFER algorithm

Raster files named "Alb_24.tif", "NDVI.tif", "LST.tif", "Rn_MJ", "kc.tif" , "evapo.tif", "LE_MJ.tif", "H_MJ.tif" and "G_MJ.tif" will be generated with the same projection as the raster input.
